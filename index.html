    <h3>Bio</h3>

    <p>

        Clinging on to a vision of changing the world with their art, these three
        versatile blend of artists<span> Mordecai Mwini Kimeu, Wachira Gatama and Kenneth
            Muya Mukhwana </span>have defied all odds against them to be labelled as one of
        the best bands in Kenya. With time, they have artistically flourished into a
        revolutionary force not only in their musical poetic presentation but also in
        their conspicuously fashionable sense of futuristic style.

        Meeting in the corridors of their acting careers at the Kenya national theatre
        in late 2012, the three discovered that they share a similar passion for music,
        spoken word/poetry, fashion and arts in general. Not long after H_ART THE BAND
        was formed. They later joined Penya Africa’s prestigious artist development program
        Sauti Academy from which they graduated in April 2014; after a year of hard work,
        determination and performing at almost every venue and street corner in Nairobi hence
        building an ever growing steady reputation with various audiences.

            Heavily inspired by day-to-day experiences, their music speaks to generations: from the
            young to the aged. With Mordecai and Wachira both being “Slam Africa poetry Kings,”
            self-taught guitarist Kenchez compliments their rhymes with smooth African tunes, while
            Mordecai adorns their jams with his vocals, thus creating a fresh genre
            they like to call<span> AFRO-POETRY.</span>

            With only a few years in the Kenyan music industry, they have been named in the MCSK
            top 10 highest earning artists list in Kenya. In 2015 they won the Mdundo
            platinum award for having more than 50,000 online downloads. With nominations for
            awards such as Mdundo Awards ‘Best Afro-pop single’ and ‘Best overall single’ for
            their debut single ‘Uliza kiatu’. The song has also landed them two nominations in
            the All Africa Music Awards (AFRIMA 2015) ‘Revelation of the African continent’ and
            ‘Most promising artist in Africa’.


        </p>
        <p>
            Tagging from their eclectic to die for performances, Bingwa awards 2015
            has also nominated them as ‘Stage performer of the year’. With four singles
            released under their label Penya Africa: Uliza Kiatu, Nikikutazama , Love
            phobic and their latest Baby love being on heavy rotation in various
            stations there is no limit to the amount of greatness they harbor.

            <a href="https://youtu.be/rd00ZV9yPAU">H_art&nbsp;the Band&nbsp;</a>
            is not your average Kenyan band. The band hints as much with its debut album Made in the
            Streets, in which the songs do the bragging. Made in the Streets is a wholesale
            reinvention of the band's sound – music that lives up to the first impression H_art the
            Band made with 2014's 'Uliza Kiatu' (Ask My Shoes).

    <h1 style="color:blueviolet;">My Favourite Band Introductory</h1>
    <p>H_art the band is My Favorite since they have a somewhat gospel record off the album dubbed
        ‘El Shaddai’ that features the super talented record producer Cedo that you can’t seem to
        get enough of once you listen to it for the very first time. I for one, have had that song
        on rotation since Friday to this day, I guess that’s what happens when talented artistes
        and record producers decide to work together.</p>
    <p>
        It finally came to fruition, H_art The Band released their debut album dubbed ‘H_art The Band’
        and just like their music overall, it didn’t disappoint one bit.

        The album is already a classic and it’s only a couple days old. You got to listen to the album
        to understand how phenomenal the album truly is.

        H_art The Band’s members comprising of talented artistes and poets Mordecai Mwini ,Wachira Gatama,
        Kenneth Muya <span>met at the Kenya National Theatre (KNT) back in 2012,</span> the same year they formed
        the group finally compiled a project for their fans and released it a couple days back and it is
        worth the wait even though it was long overdue.

        The album has few features coming from Nyota Ndogo, Kaskazini, Seyi Shay, Bensoul, Victoria Kimani,
        Sauti Sol, Cindy Sanyu, Randy Valentine and Cedo. The entire album has a total of 13-tracks.
